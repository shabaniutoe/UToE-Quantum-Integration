# UToE – Quantum Integration

This repository contains a structural analysis of bounded integration dynamics
in quantum systems. The goal of this work is to evaluate whether selected
quantum integration measures exhibit constrained, monotonic saturation
behavior under known physical regimes.

This study does not propose new quantum mechanics, modify existing postulates,
or introduce speculative mechanisms. Instead, it tests structural compatibility
between bounded integration models and empirically grounded quantum quantities.

## Scope

This repository examines integration dynamics in the following quantum contexts:

- Entanglement growth and saturation
- Decoherence and environment-induced integration limits
- Many-body quantum systems
- Measurement-driven information accumulation

The analysis is explicitly adversarial and identifies both compatible regimes
and known failure modes.

## Paper

The full manuscript is provided in:

- `paper.md` — complete paper (abstract → conclusion)

A citable archived version will be hosted on OSF.

## Reproducibility

- `environment.yml` — computational environment
- `methods/` — methodological definitions
- `analysis/` — analysis scripts (to be added)
- `data/` — dataset descriptors (no raw proprietary data)

## Relationship to Other Domains

This repository is part of a multi-domain structural validation program:

- Neural systems (separate repository)
- Genetic systems (separate repository)
- Cosmology (separate repository)
- Quantum systems (this repository)

Each domain is evaluated independently to preserve falsifiability.
